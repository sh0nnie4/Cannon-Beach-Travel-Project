                        The best overall beach in Oregon
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Cannon Beach is a famous, picturesque small-town village by the sea. It’s been recognized as the
                        “best
                        overall beach in
                        Oregon”, one of America’s best art towns, and one of the world’s most beautiful places.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Named after a naval cannon that washed up after a shipwreck in the 1840’s, Cannon Beach has a
                        ton of
                        character. Haystack
                        Rock is a massive towering rock formation off the coast, with adjacent stone “needles”, vibrant
                        tidepools, and flocks of
                        seabirds adorning the landmark. Nearby Ecola State Park is perched dramatically on the edge of a
                        headland and offers
                        panoramic coastal views, easy walking paths to scenic picnic areas, and extensive hiking trails.
